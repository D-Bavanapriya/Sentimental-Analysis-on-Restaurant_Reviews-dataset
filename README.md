# Sentimental-Analysis-on-Restaurant_Reviews-dataset
This project focuses on performing Sentiment Analysis on a dataset of restaurant reviews, classifying each review as either positive or negative. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the project aims to analyze customer feedback and provide insights into their satisfaction levels.
# Preprocessing Steps:
* Text cleaning
* Tokenization
* Stopword removal
* Vectorization (using techniques like TF-IDF or Bag of Words)
# Key Features
# Data Preprocessing:

Reviews are cleaned through tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming.
Vectorization methods like Bag of Words or TF-IDF are used to convert the text into a format suitable for model training.
# Modeling:

Various classification algorithms are employed, such as:
# Naive Bayes
A probabilistic classifier used for its simplicity and efficiency in text classification.
# Logistic Regression
A linear model for binary classification tasks.
# Support Vector Machines (SVM)
 A powerful algorithm that finds the best boundary between classes.
# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 
A simple, instance-based algorithm used for small datasets.
The model is trained to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) for each review based on the text data.
# Performance Evaluation:

The modelâ€™s effectiveness is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
The dataset is split into training and test sets to evaluate model performance and avoid overfitting.
Applications
This project is valuable for restaurants and businesses to analyze customer feedback, improve service, and understand customer sentiments at scale. It can be extended to other review datasets, making it adaptable for broader applications in customer sentiment analysis.

By using this model, businesses can:

Monitor customer satisfaction in real-time.
Make data-driven decisions to enhance customer experience.
This repository includes the dataset, preprocessing code, model training, and performance analysis scripts.
